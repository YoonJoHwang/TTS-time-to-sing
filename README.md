# Korean Singing Voice Synthesis based on Auto-regressive Boundary Equilibrium GAN
This repository contains PyTorch code for [Korean Singing Voice Synthesis based on Auto-regressive Boundary Equilibrium GAN](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9053950). The system generates singing voice from given text and MIDI in an end-to-end manner.

**You might test the code but it is still unstable**

# Dataset
In the paper we used our own dataset and we plan to release the dataset. 
If you want to use your own dataset, the dataset needs to meet few conditions.

Each song must have text(.txt), MIDI(.mid) and audio(.wav) and MIDI and audio should be temporally aligned. Currently the system only supports Korean. Text files assume to have the same number of syllables as MIDI notes then the text is aligned using MIDI note duration. You can follow the structure of 'sample_dataset'.

# Configuration
Check configuration files in 'config' folder.
- default_train.yml: Default configuration file for preprocess.py and train.py
- default_infer.yml: Default configuration file for preprocess.py and train.py

Change configurations before you run following steps and important parameters are as below.
- file_structure: File structure of dataset, 1: all the files in one folder, 2: .txt, .mid, .wav are in separated folders
- dataset_path: Path for dataset
- num_proc: The number of processes especially for preprocess.py
- use_cpu: Forcing code to use cpu and ignore 'device' parameter
- device: List of CUDA device indices (e.g. device: [0, 1] will use cuda:0 and cuda:1)
- batch_size: Training batch size
- data_mode: Dataloader mode, single: loading entire data on memory, multi: loading data with queue

# Preprocessing
```bash
python preprocess.py -c config/default_train.yml --use_cpu True
```

You can speed up preprocessing by increasing the number of processes or 'num_proc'.
You can use preprocess.py with GPU but 'num_proc' should be 1.

# Training
```bash
python train.py -c config/default_train.yml --device 0 --batch_size 64
```

If your system doesn't have enough memory, you can change 'data_mode' to 'multi' which loads data with queue.

# Inference
```bash
python infer.py -c config/default_infer.yml config/default_infer.yml --device 0
```

Specify text file and checkpoint file in the configuration and the code assumes that MIDI file has same base name as text file.
